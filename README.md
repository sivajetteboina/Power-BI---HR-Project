Greetings, everyone!

I've successfully completed a fascinating project in the HR domain, and I'm excited to introduce you to "Human Resource Analytics in HR Domain."

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗜'𝘃𝗲 𝗟𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱: This journey has allowed me to delve into the unique challenges of the Human Resources Domain and employ my data analytics skills to address real-world problems.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁: The project aimed to provide data-driven insights to the Human Resources team in the HR domain. It's a thrilling challenge to use data analytics to address real-world challenges and make informed decisions.

𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁𝘀 U𝘁𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗱: Using Power BI, I've developed a live dashboard that provides key insights into crucial aspects of the Human Resources Domain:

**KPIs:** 
   1. Total Employees: It shows total number of employees including both male and female in the company.
   2. Total Male Employees Count with Percentage: It shows count and percentage of total male employees in the company.
   3. Total Female Employees Count with Percentage: It shows count and percentage of total female employees in the company.

**Gender by value and % percentages:** Created performance column: 3 = High ratings and above is Low ratings.

**Job satisfaction column:** Created job satisfaction column as
  1.High
                             2.Medium
                             3.Low

**promotion column:** Created using years since last promoted column as Above 10 years should be due for promotion and the rest year will not be due.

**Created column for retirement and show this following:** Due for retirment and On service.

**Created distance from home column with the following:**
                              1.Very far
                              2.Close
                              3.Very close

The employees that need promotions and retirment are showed in the dashboard.

It's been an incredible learning experience, exploring the specific challenges and insights of the Human Resources domain. Each industry has its own unique data landscape to navigate.
